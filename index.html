    Hello, boy! <br>

    To add a file in the repository:
    <div class="code">
        git add $file$
    </div>
    To add a commitment 
    <div class="code">
        git commit -m "Your message of changes here"
    </div>   
    Getting the git status you can see how often commitments have you done
    so far:
    <div class="code">
        git status
    </div>
    Adding the comand to push, you upload the data you have done:
    <div class="code">
        git push -u
    </div>
    The commit -m is just to commit a unique file at a time, if u want to 
    commit a lot of files, use:
    <div class="code">
        git commit -am "message here"
    </div>
    And if your are working with more people, you can download the new code:
    <div class="code">
        git pull
    </div>
    So I'm editing this File rn and this should appear when a get the command pull :). And yes it does XD
<br><br>
    In a conflict(A partner edits a part and you also edits that part, in a different way), github
    would automatically put a text like: <br>
    Code hasn't change <br>
    <<<<< <br>
    /Your code part modified/    <br>
    ===== <br>
    /Your partner part modified/ <br>
    >>>>> <br>

    <br>
    To see who have made edits yo can run:
    <div class="code">
        git log 
    </div>
    Every commit has an id, this id can be used to reset the repository:
    <div class="code">
        git reset "id"
    </div>
    <br>
    U can get a lot of branches, adding new futures and etc, the "head" is referred as
    the main branch, where is the main code. <br>
    typing <br>
    <div class="code">
        git branch 
    </div>
    You get the branch you currently are. To get a new branch you can text <br>
    <div class="code">
        git checkout -b "Name Of the new branch"
    </div>
    To switch between branches you can use:
    <div class="code">
        git checkout "branch Name"
    </div>
    If we say you have complete the other branch(Feature) 
    and now you wanna maerge it, then:
    <div class="code">
        git merge "Branche Name"
    </div>
